            <p><li> <a name="answer1">Unfortunately, these are starches. You need to add vegetables to your daily meals. The more variety in colour you add,
            the better the variety of vitamins and minerals. Red bell peppers, yellow squash, purple eggplant, green beans, orange
            pumpkin—try them all. In a salad, soup, with your meat, in a stew, or even with your rice as a pilaf. </a> </p>

            <p><li> <a name="answer2">Eating well is good. But you need to be hydrating well too. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include fatigue, nausea,
            headache, and dry skin. Ensure that you are drinking enough water and other healthy fluids, like coconut water,
            unsweetened juices, soups, lemon juice and herbal teas. The colour of your urine is a fairly reliable marker of your
            levels of hydration. If it’s darker than pale yellow, you need more fluids.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer3">The bottom line is calories. If your total calorie intake exceeds what your body can burn, then you gain weight.
            Although calories in rice add up fast [1/3 cup cooked rice has almost 100 calories], omitting rice may not be the only
            way to cut down on calories. Keep a food diary for a week and consult a nutritionist to help identify the hidden
            calories in your diet.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer4">“Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper” goes the old saying. However, our lifestyles
            have become much more sedentary since the feudal times. Eating a large breakfast if you are just going to be sitting at
            your desk the entire day isn’t recommended. It also doesn’t mean skipping lunch if you’ve eaten a lot in the morning.
            Instead, spread your calorie intake through the day. Large gaps between meals might lead to hyperacidity.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer5">If you wait until you are hungry, you will eat more than you should be eating. Eating wholesome, balanced meals and
            snacks every 2 – 3 hours helps keep your metabolism high [which is the key to fat loss], blood sugar levels stable, and
            energy levels high. It is important to spread your overall calorie intake through the day and include all six food
            groups [starch, fruits, vegetables, meat/protein, dairy, and fats] in your daily meal plan.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer6">These fruits contain more sugar than some other fruits; so the serving sizes are smaller for these fruits as they
            contain more calories. Half a medium-size mango and half a banana have the same calories as a tennis-ball size apple.
            The best time to have a banana, mango, or chikoo is post an aerobic workout such as a run to help replenish energy
            stores in your muscles.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer7">More than the food itself, what causes hyperacidity is irregular eating patterns. If your stomach remains empty for long
            due to large gaps between meals or snacks, the acid in your stomach, which aids in digestion, has nothing to digest.
            This creates an acidic environment in the stomach—what we call acidity. The best way to prevent hyperacidity is to eat
            small meals/snacks every 2 – 3 hours. You must also drink enough water to help digestion of foods and avoid drinking
            excess tea or coffee [two cups of tea/coffee are good enough.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer8">Beans and lentils are good sources of protein. If you are a vegetarian, there are other sources of protein that you can
            add to your diet. These include: paneer [cottage cheese], light tofu, low-fat or skim milk and yoghurt, and soy beans.
            Add grilled paneer to your salad, blend tofu with skim milk into soups to make thicker and creamier soups, and have
            buttermilk/chaas as an afternoon snack.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer9">Taking a calcium citrate or calcium carbonate supplement is okay. However, your body is better at absorbing minerals
            from foods than from supplements. If you don’t like milk, you can try other sources of calcium such as broccoli,
            spinach, sardines, and fortified soy milk. Vitamin D is required for appropriate absorption of calcium too, so ensure
            you check vitamin D levels in your body if you do not get at least 10 – 15 minutes of exposure to the sun every day.</a></p>

            <p><li><a name="answer10">All oils, with the exception of palm oils, are healthy when used in small amounts. It is best to use a variety of oils
            for cooking—rice bran oil, vegetable oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil. Keep changing your oil every month; that way you
            can get both the heart healthy fats—monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats—in your diet.</a></p>
